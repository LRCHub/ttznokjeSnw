Oh she’s sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin’
I’m-ma-ma-ma out ma mind
Oh, she’s hot but a psycho
So left but she’s right though
At night she screamin’
I’m-ma-ma-ma out ma mind
She’ll make you curse, but she
a blessing
She’ll rip your shirt within a
second
You’ll be coming back, back for
seconds
With your plate, you just can’t
help it
No noo, you’ll play along
Let her lead you on, on, on
You’ll be saying, no, no
Then saying, yes, yes, yes
‘Cause she messin’ with your
head
Oh, she’s sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin’
I’m-ma-ma-ma out ma mind
Oh, she’s hot but a psycho
So left but she’s right though
At night she screamin’
I’m-ma-ma-ma out ma mind
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
She’s poison but tasty
Yeah, people say, run, don’t
walk away
Oh, she’s sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin’
I’m-ma-ma-ma out ma mind
See someone said
Don’t drink her potions
She’ll kiss your neck
With no emotions
When she’s mean
You know you love it
‘Cause she tastes so sweet
Don’t sugar coat it
No noo, you’ll play along
Let her lead you on, on, on
You’ll be saying, no , no no,
no
Then saying, yes, yes, yes
‘Cause she messin’ with your
head
Oh, she’s sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin’
I’m-ma-ma-ma out ma mind
Oh, she’s hot but a psycho
So left but she’s right though
At night she screamin’
I’m-ma-ma-ma out ma mind
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
She’s poison but tasty
Yeah, people say, run, don’t
walk away
Oh, she’s sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin’
I’m-ma-ma-ma out ma mind
You’re just like me
You’re out your mind
I know it’s strange
We’re bot the crazy kind
You’re tellin’ me
That I’m insane
Boy don’t pretend
That you don’t love the pain
Oh, she’s sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin’
I’m-ma-ma-ma out ma mind
Oh, she’s hot but a psycho
So left but she’s right though
At night she screamin’
I’m-ma-ma-ma out ma mind
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
She’s poison but tasty
Yeah, people say, run, don’t

‘Cause she’s sweet but a

A little bit psycho
At night she screamin’
